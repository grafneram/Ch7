Create a program that puts the values 23, 79, 41, 68, 17, 39, 51, 75, 95, 19 into an array.

The program should then print all 10 integers. 

The program should then read all integers in the array and determine the smallest integer in the array. 

The program should then print the smallest integer value.

Sample run:

Integer values: 23, 79, 41, 68, 17, 39, 51, 75, 95, 19

Smallest integer: 17
